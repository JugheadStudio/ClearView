## Development Process

### Highlights
Highlights of the dashboard is the simplistic UI and the functionality that gives the user a plesent use experience.
The Dashboard is easy to understand and navigate.

### Challenges
For the most part building this dashboard wasn't too dificult once I started getting familiar with PHP and mySQL and figured out how to make use of the error messages to locate bugs in my code.

The most dificult functionality to impliment was allowing the user to reset their password view an automated email as well as building a decent calender which I was not able to finish in time so I went for a more simplistic approach by having appointment cards.

## Future Implementations

* Full blown interactive calendar
* Building this dashboard in such a way that it can be easily customised to accomodate more than just a doctors office
